## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am studying Cyber Security Level 4 (BSc) at Leeds Beckett University!
I am also a first year student.
One fun fact about me is that I used to play amateur table tennis when I was 11 years old.
I'm intrested in gaming of course and UFC (Mixed Martial Arts).
One of my goals is to travel the world. This is what I plan to do once I get my degree and secure a good job. :)
